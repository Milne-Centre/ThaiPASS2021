# ThaiPASS2021


##########################################

All student participants must complete and submit the pre-ThaiPASS exercise before arriving at ThaiPASS.

For students with little or no Python experience, we recommend that you register and work on the basic Python ThaiMOOC by Dr Teeraparb Chantavat.

The exercise will be in the form of an iPython notebook which you can use Anaconda to open (using the Jupyter Notebook application).

Please edit the iPython notebook and email it to thaipass@hull.ac.uk  by 1st April 2021, 12noon (Thai time).

Try your best to answer all questions. We are not looking for perfect answers, but we want to see that you have tried your best! We will give feedback to all submissions.

You are welcome to send us any questions (in English) about this exercise or about Python. We will be happy to hear from you. 

Good luck!
